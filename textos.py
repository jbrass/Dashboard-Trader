resumen_semanal = "data for general CPI downward, observing that inflation for the part of goods seems controlled, but remains resistant for the component of services. This was confirmed with the PPI data for Thursday, where we saw a noticeable reduction to 2.7% vs. the previous 4.9%, thereby marking the lowest level since January 2021. The US economy is beginning to show symptoms of weakening with lower manufacturing production data, with the falls in retail sales affected by the lower volume of vehicle sales and the cooling of the labor market in this first quarter of the year, and this denotes that families are beginning to feel the rise interest rates together with the still high levels of inflation and consume less. On the European side, we had the final CPI data from Germany and Spain, which met expectations, and that from France, which surprised slightly on the rise, as well as the data on industrial production in the Eurozone, which increased by 2% year-on-year, showing the resilience of the European manufacturing sector. On the part of the bonds, there were falls in the context of the statements by Christopher Waller of the FED, reinforcing the discourse of the course of interest rates to be done by keeping inflation far from the 2% target and, in Europe, we also saw falls due to the prospects for further tightening of monetary policy by the European Central Bank given economic resilience based on the latest data"

renta_variable = "**US stocks closed higher (S&P 500 0.77%, DJI 1.20%)**, driven by positive inflation data and a relatively good start to the first quarter earnings season with big banks demonstrating strength in its margins. At the sectoral level, Financials, due to the banking results, and Energy, due to the increases in oil, were the most prominent sectors compared to Utilities and Real Estate, which gave the negative note. In Europe, the Stoxx 600 rose 1.74%, highlighting the increases in the Italian and French index, both around 2.50% weekly. At the sector level, the Financial sector also stood out, derived from the good behavior of the banks and the Consumer Discretionary sector, compared to the falls experienced by the Utilities and Airlines sectors. As for emerging markets, the Chinese stock markets posted mixed results, as lower-than-expected inflation dampened investor sentiment, both in terms of the CPI and the PPI. New lending and trade balance data surprised to the upside, but were not enough to offset general concerns about the strength of the economic recovery"
