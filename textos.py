subtitulo_semanal = " **Risk assets maintained bullish tone**"
resumen_semanal = "The week was marked by meetings of central banks, which delivered as expected in terms of interest rate hikes: FED 25pb, ECB and BoE 50pb. So far, so expected, but it was Powell's less combative tone that gave investors reason, who remain convinced that the FED will come to the rescue of the economy in the second half of the year. This also served as support in the European region, despite the more aggressive tone of Christine Lagarde and confirmation by the monetary authority of another 50pb hike for its March meeting, in this case the complex situation of public finances in the countries of southern Europe make more than one think that the ECB will not be able to do everything it would like to calm inflation."
titulo_cuerpo = " **Mixed macro data at the close of the week**"
cuerpo_semanal = "On the positive side: PMI's coming out of contraction zone and better-than-expected GDP growth data in the eurozone; but we also had negative data that continues to sow doubt, such as: a major warning in the rebound in underlying inflation data in the European region, to which were added much better-than-expected job data in the United States, which prevent ruling out second rounds in the price level."
