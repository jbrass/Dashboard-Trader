resumen_semanal = "A week of widespread falls, both in the stock markets and in the price of bonds, mainly motivated by the declarations of various members of the central banks reiterating once again that interest rates, although close to their maximum in this cycle of increases, are not They will drop in the second half of the year. And this time it seems that the message has penetrated more among investors (especially after the latest US employment report), since expectations of interest rate cuts have been delayed by a quarter. While waiting for the inflation data in the US on Tuesday, the market has gradually shifted its attention from inflation to growth and looking to the future, the evolution of this balance between the two forces will be crucial, what measures Central Banks adopt and what is the trajectory of corporate profits. Corporate profits that are on track to mark their first quarter of declines in year-on-year terms since 2020 but the market remains very benign, even with companies that do not beat expectations, perhaps because they are discounting a soft landing for the economies and a relaxation of continued financial conditions. Regarding published macro data, retail sales in the Eurozone surprised on the downside, as did German industrial production. But perhaps it was the German inflation data that surprised the most with a rise of one tenth (8.7%) and which probably implies a revision of the aggregate inflation data for the European Union."
