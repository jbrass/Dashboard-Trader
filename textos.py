resumen_semanal = "On the one hand there were some positive signs of corporate profits in Europe, against the great concern that inflationary trends could be taking a turn for the worse on the US side. The week was marked by inflation data in the US that confirm a more gradual slowdown in price growth than expected, above all, due to the services component and, specifically, shelter costs, an item that refers to the Mortgage from the rental market, cost and supply of water and electricity in the home. Apart from the inflation data, we had the data for retail sales, which rose by a notorious 3% per month, and the data for industrial prices and the construction sector, which were worse than expected as a whole. On the European side, Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, spoke in the European Parliament stressing that economic activity will continue to be weak, with interest rates remaining and that in March the ECB rate hike will be 50 bps. Regarding macro references in Europe, there were positive results, a striking drop in core inflation in the United Kingdom (5.8% vs. 6.3% previously) and preliminary quarterly GDP data for the Eurozone, which It came out in line with expectations (1.9%), which corresponds to the context for the rises in the European stock markets. On the fixed income side, the bond markets suffered from the inflationary context and a FED with a discourse more prone to maintaining rate hikes and raising the marginal rate above the 4.75%-5% that was estimated ahead of this month's inflation and employment data."

title_renta_variable = "**Equities**"
renta_variable = "Slight falls in the S&P 500 (-0.28%) reflecting the concern after the inflationary data and the expectations of future rate hikes by the FED. At the sectoral level, the increases in the Consumer Discretionary and Utilities sectors stood out, compared to the falls in Real Estate and Energy, the latter hard hit by the sharp falls in natural gas and oil prices. European stocks rallied as better-than-expected corporate results and a larger-than-expected drop in UK inflation helped markets dampen negative sentiment on possible interest rate hikes, with a Stoxx highlighted 600 with a rise of 1.40%. At the sector level, the Telecommunications and Auto sectors stood out, compared to the marked falls in the Energy and Real Estate sectors, with the same energy context commented on in the US case. Bad week in Emerging Markets, highlighting the third consecutive week of falls in the Chinese stock market in the context of the escalation of political tension with the US, followed by those of the Korean KOSPI and those of LATAM, highlighting Chile and Mexico, all marked by a dollar context strengthened."

title_renta_fija = "**Fixed income**"
renta_fija = "Falls in bonds after the inflation data and a predictably more active Fed in raising interest rates, expanding the marginal rate above the 5% that it had estimated prior to the inflation data. This halts the rise in long rates and further widens the inversion of the curve with spreads between 2-10 years (recession indicator) increasingly pronounced to levels not seen for more than 40 years. As for the spreads, they widened both in Investment Grade, as well as in European and US High Yield, although they are still far from the wide levels of October last year."

title_divisa_mater = "**Currencies and Commodities**"
divisa_materia = "Marked decline in the price of natural gas (9.86%) and oil (4.30% WTI) due to the possible effects on the demand for these materials due to the warm winter and the FED rate hikes. This sentiment pushed the US dollar higher, making oil more expensive against other currencies."
