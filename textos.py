subtitulo_semanal = " **Last Friday came to an end a quarter that left important revaluations **"
resumen_semanal = "For most of the stock markets and with the NASDAQ100 in a bullish market after rising more than 20%. In Fixed Income, most government bonds are trading below year-start rates, the less inverted US curve and flat credit spreads. At the macroeconomic level, most of the available data continues to show superior strength of the economies despite the fact that the confidence surveys do not manage to stand out as much as might be expected for the readings we are seeing. Inflation continues to be the big unknown given that base effects have caused lower price growth (in Spain the CPI for March was 3.3% Vs 6% previously) but the core rate continues to mark all-time highs and the readings MoM would point to an annualized inflation rate close to 5%. Perhaps for this reason the Central Banks have continued with their pattern of interest rate hikes. With this description of events it would be hard for us to believe that three North American banks have failed during the quarter and a systemic bank like Credit Suisse was taken over by its rival UBS with the intervention of the Swiss government assuming losses of up to CHF 9,000M. But that's how the market works: it puts a price on what is to come and quickly forgets the past. Q2 begins today, in which many of the hopes rest on the idea of reaching a peak in official interest rates."

title_renta_variable = "**Equities**"
renta_variable = "**Good closing of the month** and quarter for the North American indices in which calm gradually returned after two weeks of intense volatility caused by bank failures. All sectors ended positively last week and where the energy sector stood out after OPEC+'s decision to cut crude oil production by more than one million barrels/day. The heavyweights of the index (Alphabet, Microsoft, Google...) accumulate revaluations of more than 30%. Increases also for the European stock markets that also lead the table of returns at a global level. The resilience of growth in the Eurozone together with the reopening of China have been two important catalysts for valuations that were at relatively attractive levels vs. North American companies. Banks, energy companies and companies related to leisure and consumption have led the profitability table in recent weeks, leaving behind the episodes of doubts about the health of the European banking system. Despite the surprise reopening of China, the emerging indices are the furthest behind in the calculation of the year. In the last week we learned that Alibaba will divide the company into 6 business units that will function independently, which was very well received by the market. The company's shares rose 16% and encouraged Hong Kong's Hang Seng."

title_renta_fija = "**Fixed income**"
renta_fija = "Week with significant rises for the government curves, especially in the short tranches, although still far from the highs seen before the episode of bank panic. The inflation data probably fueled a push higher this week despite the fact that the data offered much debate as to what is the correct reading of the data. In corporate bonds we are witnessing a very important understanding of spreads."

title_divisa_mater = "**Currencies and Commodities**"
divisa_materia = "The barrel of Brent is close to $80/barrel after the OPEC+ decision to cut oil production and a cut in the supply of an oil pipeline between Turkey and Iran. The Euro gains ground against the USD after the rise in interest rates and gold remains flat."
